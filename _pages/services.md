Fundamentally, Grimes IT creates value by developing web applications.

### JavaScript

Modern web development means **JavaScript**.
I use client-side JavaScript frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular to provide rich user experiences.
Additional "batteries included" frameworks like NextJS (for React) and NuxtJS (for Vue) can be helpful to add some server-side magic, and to simplify best practice and architecture decisions. 

Most web applications need more than just JavaScript, though.

### Databases

**Data** is the molten core of a web business, and it needs to be stored and used in a secure and efficient way.
An RDBMS like Postgres or MySQL is often a good choice for the core databases,
though a NoSQL store like MongoDB can have its place.
I use other data technologies as needed for specialized purposes, like Redis, Elasticsearch, Memcache, and OpenAI.

### Business logic

**Business logic** is often distributed across a variety of other applications and third-party services which need to be integrated.
I'm deeply familiar with PHP applications, including full-stack frameworks like Symfony, Zend/Laminas, and Laravel, microframeworks and homemade applications, and third-party software like Wordpress and Moodle.
And I have long experience building and using APIs to integrate distributed systems, including REST and GraphQL.

## Web infrastructure

<!-- {% include feature_row id="service_infrastructure" type="left" %} -->

When I say "full-stack", I mean it. From bare metal to the cloud, servers to VMs, and containers to serverless, I have decades of experience scaling real world web applications. Before that I was a network engineer in Silicon Valley. I know TCP/IP.

I use Docker for streamlined, self-contained development environments, and to ensure identical test and production environments. Orchestration tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, or Docker Swarm can help simplify deployment and infrastructure management.

Judicious use of AWS or other cloud infrastructure can ensure scalability, but it must be carefully considered and planned to avoid cost overruns. Software must be explicitly designed to support horizontal scaling to take advantage of savings opportunities in the cloud.

## Modernizing legacy applications

<!-- {% include feature_row id="service_legacy" type="right" %} -->

Over 75% of websites use PHP, according to [surveys by W3Techs](https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php),
and 20% of those are still running PHP 5 (which is end-of-life and no longer receiving security updates).

Hard-earned experience has shown that sites don't stay on PHP 5 because they like it. 
It can be extremely challenging to upgrade an established legacy site to modern versions of PHP without disrupting the existing application--but it can be done. It takes a well-thought-out migration plan, 
practical automated testing, mentorship and training, and some patience.

Legacy applications typically need to be able to coexist and integrate with newer technologies,
to take advantage of faster growth with newer technologies,
while still maintaining the valuable legacy codebase.
