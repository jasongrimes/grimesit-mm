I’m Jason Grimes, the owner and Principal Engineer, and I’ve been doing this successfully for a long time.

I started out as a network engineer in Silicon Valley in the 1990s, installing computer labs and Internet connections at public schools. Later I was a system administrator, first in Windows and Unix, and eventually moving to the upstart Linux. I started programming in C, C++ and Java, then fell in love with the web and never looked back. I’ve programmed in PHP and JavaScript since the earliest days of both, and I’ve enjoyed the ride as both languages repeatedly reinvented themselves, along with the world around them.

Grimes IT Services, Inc. went dormant for 20 years while I built and ran the technology for ProZ.com, the world’s largest network of professional translators and a model example of a successful, bootstrapped small web business.

After a long and fortunate journey with ProZ, I eventually re-formed my own company as Grimes IT, LLC, under which banner I provide technical services to occasional clients and conduct research and development for new software products.

Though I have no employees, there’s really  no such thing as a one-man band in business or technology. I turn to my network of experts in systems, design, development, and business as each solution requires.

I'm a fixer. A pragmatist. I like to solve problems—--the more challenging, the better. 

If there's a problem I can help solve for you, please [contact me](/contact/).
