I’m **Jason Grimes**, owner and lead engineer.
I've been growing businesses on the Internet for a long time.

I build web applications and scale internet infrastructure, and have since the dawn of the World Wide Web.
Before specializing in **web development** and **DevOps**
I was a **sysadmin** on early **Unix/Linux** and **Windows**
and learned to program in **C, C++** and **Java**.
Before that I was a **network engineer** in 1990s Silicon Valley installing computer labs and internet access in public schools.

I helped start-up, scale, and operate [**ProZ.com**](https://www.proz.com/),
the world’s largest network of professional translators and linguists,
and a profitable bootstrapped small company.
It was a remarkably successful web business, so I did that a long time.

Now I own [**Grimes IT, LLC**](https://grimesit.com),

I'm supported by a network of friends and seasoned experts in systems, design, development, and business, with whom I am proud to associate.
