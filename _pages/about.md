**Grimes IT, LLC** provides [technical services](/services/) to web-based businesses and conducts original research and development.

I’m Jason Grimes, owner and Principal Engineer. 
I build web applications. I have for a long time.

Starting as a network engineer in 1990s Silicon Valley, 
I installed computer labs and Internet in a dozen cash-strapped public schools.
I was a **sysadmin** for **Unix**, **Windows**, and early **Linux**,
learned programming in **C, C++** and **Java**,
then fell in love with the World Wide Web and specialized in web applications.
I’ve written production **PHP** and **JavaScript** since the dawn of both,
and with them maturing into serious languages that run the modern web.

I helped start-up, scale, and operate [**ProZ.com**](https://www.proz.com/),
now the world’s largest network of professional translators and linguists,
and a good model of a long-term profitable, bootstrapped small business.
It was successful, so I did that for a long time.

Now I own **Grimes IT**,
providing technical services to select clients
and conducting original research and development.
I have no employees,
but I'm supported by a professional network of friends and experts in systems, design, development, and business.

I am a fixer. A pragmatist. I like to solve useful problems.

Can I solve a problem for you? [Contact me](/contact/).
