**Grimes IT, LLC** provides technical [services](/services/) to web-based businesses and conducts original research and development.

I’m **Jason Grimes**, owner and Principal Engineer. 
I build **web applications**, and have for a long time.

I do **full-stack JavaScript** with **NodeJS, ES6, React, Next, Express**, and so on.
I’ve written production **JavaScript** and **PHP** code since the dawn of both languages,
as they matured into serious technologies that run the **modern web**.
Before I **specialized in web apps**
I was a **sysadmin** in **Unix**, **Windows**, and early **Linux**,
and learned to program in **C, C++** and **Java**.
Before that I was a **network engineer** in 1990s Silicon Valley installing computer labs and Internet in a dozen public schools.

I helped start-up, scale and operate [**ProZ.com**](https://www.proz.com/),
now the world’s largest network of professional translators and linguists,
and a good model of a long-term profitable, bootstrapped small business.
It was successful so I did that a long time.

Now I own [**Grimes IT, LLC**](https://grimesit.com),
the legal entity under which I provide 
technical services to select clients
and conduct original research and development.
I have no employees,
but I'm supported by a professional network of friends and experts in systems, design, development, and business,
to whom I am grateful.

I am a fixer. A pragmatist. I like to solve useful problems.
If I can solve a problem for you, please [contact](/contact/) me.
