**Grimes IT, LLC** builds web applications, provides technical [services](/services/) to web-based businesses, and conducts original research and development.

I’m **Jason Grimes**, owner and Principal Engineer. 
I've been building web applications a long time.

I do **full-stack JavaScript** development with **Node, React, Next, Express**, and so on.
I’ve written production **JavaScript** and **PHP** code since the dawn of both languages,
as they matured into serious technologies that run the modern web.
Before **specializing in web apps**
I was a **sysadmin** in early **Linux**, **Unix**, and **Windows**
and learned to program in **C, C++** and **Java**.
Before that I was a **network engineer** in 1990s Silicon Valley installing computer labs and Internet in a dozen public schools.

I helped start-up, scale and operate [**ProZ.com**](https://www.proz.com/)
into the world’s largest network of professional translators and linguists,
and a profitable bootstrapped small web business.
It was successful, so I did that awhile.

Now I own [**Grimes IT, LLC**](https://grimesit.com),
a small business that builds web applications and provides technical products and services.
I have no employees,
but I'm supported by a network of friends and seasoned experts in systems, design, development, and business,
to whom I am grateful.

I am a fixer. A pragmatist. I like to solve useful problems.
If I can solve a problem for you, please [contact](/contact/) me.
