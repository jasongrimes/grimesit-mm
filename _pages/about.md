[Grimes IT, LLC](/) provides technical services to web-based businesses and conducts original research and development.
(See [services](/services/).)

I’m Jason Grimes, owner and Principal Engineer. I’ve been doing this for a long time.

I started out as a network engineer in Silicon Valley in the 1990s, installing computer labs and Internet connections at public schools. Then I was a system administrator, in Unix, Windows, and young upstart Linux.
I learned to program in C, C++ and Java,
then fell in love with the Internet and began to specialize in web applications.
I’ve written production PHP and JavaScript code since the earliest days of both,
seen their best practices grow and change over time,
and enjoyed their evolution into mature and powerful languages that run the modern web.

I helped start-up, scale, and operate [ProZ.com](https://www.proz.com/),
(now the world’s largest network of professional translators and linguists)
and a good model of a long-term profitable, bootstrapped small business.
It was successful, so I did that for a long time.
Eventually I went out on my own again,
to provide technical services to select clients,
and conduct original research and development.

Though I have no employees, there is no such thing as a one man band--at least not in business or technology. 
I'm supported a network of friends and experts in systems, design, development, and business, as needed.

I'm a fixer. A pragmatist. I like to solve problems that matter. 

Do you have a problem I can solve? [Contact me](/contact/).
