[Grimes IT, LLC](/) provides technical services to web-based businesses and conducts original reasearch and development.

I’m Jason Grimes, owner and Principal Engineer. I’ve been doing this for a long time.

I started out as a network engineer in Silicon Valley in the 1990s, installing computer labs and Internet connections at public schools. Later I was a system administrator, in Unix, Windows, and then upstart Linux. 
I learned to program in C, C++ and Java. 
I fell in love with the Internet and focused on web applications. 
I’ve written production PHP and JavaScript since the earliest days of both languages, 
I've seen conventional wisdom change over time,
and I’ve enjoyed both languages repeatedly reinventing themselves, 
and in turn the world around them.

I helped start-up, scale, and operate [ProZ.com](https://www.proz.com/),
(now the world’s largest network of professional translators and linguists)
and a good model of a long-term profitable, bootstrapped small business.
That was successful so I did it a long time,
but eventually it was just time to go out on my own again. 
Now I provide technical services to select clients and conduct my own research and development.

Though I have no employees, there is no such thing as a one man band, 
at least in business or technology. I turn to my network of friends and experts in systems, design, development, and business as each solution requires.

I'm a fixer. A pragmatist. I like to solve problems--the harder the better. 

Is there a problem I can solve for you? [Contact me](/contact/).
