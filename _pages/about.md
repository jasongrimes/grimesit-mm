**Grimes IT, LLC** provides [technical services](/services/) to web-based businesses and conducts original research and development.

I’m **Jason Grimes**, owner and Principal Engineer. 
**I build web applications**, and have for a long time.

I’ve written production **PHP** and **JavaScript code** since the dawn of both,
as they matured into serious languages that run the modern web.
I was a **sysadmin** for **Unix**, **Windows**, and early **Linux**,
learned programming in **C, C++** and **Java**,
fell in love with the World Wide Web and **specialized in web applications** ever since.
Before that I installed computer labs and Internet connections in a dozen cash-strapped public schools
first starting out as a network engineer in 1990s Silicon Valley.

I helped start-up, scale and operate [**ProZ.com**](https://www.proz.com/),
now the world’s largest network of professional translators and linguists,
and a good model of a long-term profitable, bootstrapped small business.
It was successful so I did that a long time.

Now I own **Grimes IT, LLC**,
the legal entity under which I provide 
technical services to select clients
and conduct original research and development.
I have no employees,
but I'm supported by a professional network of friends and experts in systems, design, development, and business.

I am a fixer. A pragmatist. I like to solve useful problems.
If I can solve a problem for you, please [contact me](/contact/).
